"""One LLM for a whole team of robots -- the unit every topology is built from.

A *team* has one brain: it sees every member's observation in a single prompt and
answers with one plan per robot, so the division of labour inside a team is made
once, with all of it visible, instead of emerging from N agents that cannot see
each other's intentions.

This is not a fourth topology. It is the **unit** the three existing ones are
expressed in: individual / broadcast_chain / centralized describe how teams talk
to *each other*, while inside every team it is always one LLM driving four
robots. Set the team size to 1 and each topology collapses to its old
one-LLM-per-robot behaviour, which is what makes this a generalisation rather
than a replacement.

A team speaks through one member, its **spokesagent** (the first), because the
message broker is keyed by agent id and the ordering primitives the chain and the
leader already use take agent ids. But a team is *addressed* as a whole: messages
go to every member of the recipient team, so the interrupt reaches all of them.

Three rules follow from that, and each one costs something:

**The team plans together.** Members return to reasoning as a group, only once
every one of them has finished its plan. That is the requirement, and it has a
trap in it: the plan loop does not step the environment while any agent is
not ready (``run_*.py``: ``while not all(agent.ready)``). So a member that
finished early and simply waited would freeze the world, and its teammates --
who need the world to advance to finish *their* plans -- would never finish. It
would deadlock on the first uneven round, every time.

So a member that finishes early stays **ready** and holds position instead: it
takes a short ``wait`` plan and keeps taking one until the team is complete. The
world keeps advancing, the early finisher costs real ticks doing nothing, and
that idle time is the true price of a joint decision point rather than something
hidden. :class:`TeamBrain` tracks who is done through those holds
(``_awaiting``), so a member idling for three holds is still "waiting to plan",
not "planning again".

**Messages interrupt the whole team.** A message addressed to any member
interrupts all of them, and the brain answers for each in one call: resume or
replan, per robot. Per robot rather than team-wide because a message that
changes what one robot should do usually leaves the others' plans perfectly
good, and making everyone replan would throw away work the message never
contradicted. There is no deadlock here -- an interrupt arrives at every member
at once, so the barrier closes immediately.

**One LLM call per round, not N.** The brain is shared, and the runner starts a
thread per agent, so several members reach it at the same instant. The first one
through the lock makes the call; the rest read its result. Without that, four
threads would each issue the same team-wide prompt and three answers would be
thrown away.

A team of one is the degenerate case and it behaves exactly like the individual
topology: the barrier is satisfied immediately, no holds are ever taken, and the
prompt contains one observation. That is why ``team_config`` gives an unteamed
robot a team of its own -- one-LLM-per-robot is this code with N=1, not a second
code path.
