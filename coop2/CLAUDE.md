# coop2 — COOP² multi-agent cooperation on BEHAVIOR-1K

Port of `coop2-llm-mas/ma_crafter`'s LLM multi-agent cooperation stack onto
BEHAVIOR-1K. Goal: run **individual / broadcast_chain / centralized** topologies
here with minimal changes to the COOP² code, then add **decentralized**.
Repair is explicitly **not** ported.

**Read `coop2/PORTING_PLAN.md` before designing anything.** It is the canonical
design doc: seven-layer structure, the full environment-contract checklist that
COOP²'s upper layers require, the BDDL multi-agent audit, and the trap list.
This file is only the operational summary.

## Where we are (2026-09-08, evening)

**All three topologies solve the BDDL activity.** `individual`,
`broadcast_chain` and `centralized` each reached `coop_two_apples_pomaria`'s goal
at seed 0 with 2 agents and `--steps 4000`: `check_goal` fired at env_step 1303,
1303 and 1278 respectively, `{'satisfied': [0], 'unsatisfied': []}`. Runs take
about two minutes each. Reproduce with the command in "Commands" below.

| topology | goal @ step | plans | succeeded | primitives | primitive ticks | messages | LLM calls | tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| individual | 1303 | 4 | 1 | 6 | 2278 | 0 | 4 | 13731 |
| broadcast_chain | 1303 | 4 | 1 | 6 | 2278 | 3 | 6 | 22328 |
| centralized | 1278 | 4 | 1 | 6 | 1924 | 6 | 7 | 19669 |

`centralized` finishes the manipulation in 1924 primitive ticks against 2278 for
the other two, and pays 6 messages and the highest API latency for it -- which is
the trade COOP2 exists to measure. One seed proves nothing about the ordering;
that is what M7 step 3's remaining seeds are for.

**M1-M6 passed. M7 steps 1-2 passed.** M9 is wired: `coop_env` loads
OmniGibson's `BehaviorTask` from the cached instance when `bddl_activity` is set,
and `compiled_task.check_goal` is the *only* authority over `terminated`.
Acceptance criteria are in PORTING_PLAN.md section 7.

What is left:

1. **M7 step 3** -- more seeds per topology for the metrics table. Note
   `build_results_table.py` cannot read these runs: it skips any folder without
   `team_score.json`, which the runners do not write while `team_score.enabled`
   is False. Same defect class as the rest of that file (see "The recurring
   defect class" in the memory notes) -- post-episode code that only runs after
   a full GPU episode.
2. **M8** -- decentralized topology.

**Scene note:** the earlier target was `house_single_floor` (Rs_int measured
unusable, 96.2 % of sampled base poses reject). The BDDL task is on
`Pomaria_1_int`/`living_room_0` because that is where the two-armchair +
coffee-table layout exists; revisit if N=9 needs more floor area than that room
has.

## The bug that made the activity look unsolvable (2026-09-08)

`OnTop` is `Touching` and `Touching` is a contact-report query, and **a sleeping
PhysX actor emits no contact reports**. Every OmniGibson object is constructed
with `DEFAULT_SLEEP_THRESHOLD = 5e-05` (`entity_prim.py`). An apple placed on the
coffee table falls the sampler's 2 cm z-offset, comes to rest, and is slept --
after which it is still sitting on the table and `OnTop` reads False forever.

Our own placement path is what makes it arrive so fast: `_place_with_predicate`
does release -> `set_position_orientation` -> `keep_still()` -> settle, and
`keep_still()` zeroes both velocities. `keep_still()` was added by the *previous*
fix, to stop the object being flung out of the house; it cured the fling and
brought the sleep forward. Both were real.

Two readers were being lied to, which is why the fix is central
(`coop_env._keep_task_objects_awake`, applied at build and after every reset) and
not at either call site:

- `_place_with_predicate` raised EXECUTION_ERROR "it did not come to rest there"
  for a third to a half of all placements -- which reads as a physics failure and
  is not one;
- `check_goal` cannot see a delivered apple that has gone to sleep, so **no run
  could have reported success no matter how well the agents played**. That is why
  "one of two apples delivered" was the ceiling for days.

Measured, not argued -- `feasibility_verify/measure_placement_rest.py`:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| placements that come to rest, empty table | 10/20 | 20/20 |
| placements that come to rest, one apple already there | 11/20 | 20/20 |
| single-step `OnTop` reads of a settled apple | 0/20 | 20/20 |

The discriminating evidence: success and failure are geometrically identical --
same sampled and final z (0.415 -> 0.390), same `VerticalAdjacency` below/above
lists, and the radius-from-centre medians order *oppositely* in the two
conditions, i.e. noise. The neighbouring apple makes no difference (63 % vs
67 %), which killed the first hypothesis. The failing pose reports no contact
with **anything**, at velocity exactly `[0,0,0]`; `is_asleep` is the only thing
that differs, and `wake()` plus one step flips `OnTop` to True with the object
not having moved. Three geometric hypotheses were proposed and all three were
measured wrong before this one was measured right.

## Seed 3, one run per topology (2026-09-09)

| topology | end_step | goal | plans | ok / fail / cut | Y_plan | msgs | API | tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| broadcast_chain | 1956 | **solved** | 3 | 1 / 0 / 2 | 1.00 | 1 | 3 | 10 819 |
| centralized | 2094 | **solved** | 3 | 1 / 0 / 2 | 1.00 | 2 | 4 | 11 360 |
| individual | 3174 | not solved | 5 | 1 / 2 / 2 | 0.33 | 0 | 5 | 17 847 |

Four seeds now: individual 2/4, centralized 4/4, broadcast_chain 4/4. Still not
enough to separate topology from seed noise, but individual is the only one that
has ever failed, and both of its failures are physics, not coordination --
`place_on_top[EXECUTION]` at seeds 1 and 3.

### `--steps` is not the budget: `--time-limit-seconds` defaults to 120

`run_*.py` takes a wall-clock deadline (`run_individual.py:326`) that defaults to
**120 s** and stops the episode independently of `--steps`. At ~26 env_step/s
that caps a run near 3100 steps, so `--steps 4000` has never once been reachable
and every run "to 4000" was really a run to 120 s. Individual seed 3 stopped at
3174 for exactly this reason.

Re-run with `--time-limit-seconds 0` to check: it still did not solve, so this
particular result stands. But the deadline is invisible in the run folder --
nothing records which limit fired -- and it silently makes `--steps` a
lower-bound-only knob. Pass `--time-limit-seconds 0` when the step count is
meant to be the experiment variable.

### The coffee table can fly away (seen once, not yet diagnosed)

In the 4000-step individual re-run, `coffee_table_gpkbiw_0` left the living room
under constant velocity: the `NO_SPACE_AROUND_TARGET` attribution logs it at
(-10.5, -10.1), then (-14.5, -17.9), (-17.6, -24.1) ... (-46.4, -80.8), roughly
equal steps in a fixed direction -- coasting, not accelerating, i.e. it carries a
velocity nothing damps. 97 rejections, all `{'room': 200, 'trav': 0, 'robots': 0}`:
every candidate pose was rejected for being outside the room, because the target
had left it. 18 of that run's 21 plans died this way (Y_plan 0.05).

Same shape as blocker #6 but on the *receptacle*, which is supposed to be
furniture. Not present in any of the three 120 s seed-3 runs, so it is an event
during the episode rather than a step-count threshold; the obvious suspect is a
placement impulse, and `_keep_task_objects_awake` keeps the table from ever
sleeping it off. Evidence kept in
`coop2/runs/individual_agents2_repair_off_seed3_20260909_025858_415866/`.

## Two bugs the viewport exposed (2026-09-09)

A robot vanishing on its first teleport and another toppling mid-episode turned
out to be three separate defects, found by measuring the startup stages apart
(`COOP2_PLACEMENT_VERBOSE=1`, and
`feasibility_verify/measure_base_joint_limits.py`).

**1. The template's robots were the ones being simulated.** `include_robots:
False` gates the robots in the scene *USD*; it cannot stop entries restored from
the task's own cached json, and the template *is* the scene file. Proof was in the
root anchors: (300, 300, 300) and (-52, -50, 0) are the sampler's, not coop2's
`[1.5 * i, 0, 0.05]`. The state being baked in was junk -- `agent_1` stored with
its base z joint at **-0.681**, i.e. 0.68 m below the floor, and `agent_0` with a
root anchor 300 m out and every non-base joint at zero rather than the tucked
reset pose its own init_info declares. This is also what
`_enforce_controller_config` was patching after the fact. Fixed by stripping robot
entries from the template (`strip_robots_from_template` in the sampler, applied to
the existing template in place so the object layout is untouched). Now the roots
read (0, 0, 0.05) and (1.5, 0, 0.05), and both robots come up level at 0.51 deg
instead of 0.51 and **18.52**.

**2. Teleporting a robot did not zero its velocity.** Same defect as the object
placement that used to fling apples out of the house. Because `agent_1` began
underfloor, physics was already ejecting it and it left `place_robots` at
**2.72 m/s**; the orientation it is given is level, but momentum that survives the
teleport tumbles it during the next settle. `place_robots` now calls
`keep_still()`. Worth knowing this fixed the velocity but *not* the tilt -- the
tilt was defect 1, and measuring after each fix is what separated them.

**3. `if robot.is_grasping(...)` accepted a definite NO.** `IsGraspingState` is an
IntEnum: `TRUE = 1`, `UNKNOWN = 0`, **`FALSE = -1`**. So a truthiness test is true
for FALSE and false for UNKNOWN. And FALSE is precisely what a robot holding apple
A returns when asked about apple B: the gripper controller reports TRUE for
"closed on something", then downgrades to FALSE when the fingers turn out not to
touch the object asked about (`robots/robot.py`). So `holder_of` named a holder for
every object in the scene, and **the second apple went permanently
OBJECT_CLAIMED the instant the first was picked up**, with `place_on_top` failing
PRE_CONDITION on an empty hand -- the ALREADY_HELD / OBJECT_CLAIMED /
PRE_CONDITION triad in the plan log. Latent for weeks: with the template's
mis-configured robots `is_grasping` raised and the `except: break` hid it, so
fixing 1 and 2 is what surfaced it. Both call sites (`holder_of` and
`world_state`'s held-object confirmation) now go through
`is_definitely_grasping`. The stubs used to return a plain bool, which is why no
CPU test could catch it; they now return the tri-state and one does.

## Placement no longer drops the object first (2026-09-09)

Upstream's `_place_with_predicate` calls `_release()` -- which is
`release_grasp_immediately` **followed by its own settle** -- and only teleports
afterwards. Those settle ticks are the object in free fall from gripper height, so
on screen the apple dropped to the floor and *then* jumped onto the table. The
release is now split: detach, teleport, `keep_still()`, settle once. Measured with
a per-tick height trace: the apple goes 1.223 m (gripper) -> 0.409 (sampled pose,
table top is 0.358) -> 0.390, with **0 ticks below 0.15 m**. A placement also went
from ~150 ticks to 101, because a whole settle phase is gone.

## The place/grasp distance gate, measured (2026-09-09)

There is a gate -- `_require_near(obj, verb, GATE_PLACE)` -- but it is looser than
it looks. `interaction_radius_for` is the navigation annulus's upper bound plus
0.35, and that is deliberate: the gate must accept anything `navigate_to` can
produce, or an agent loops navigate -> TOO_FAR forever. The consequence is that
the slack is `reach (1.5) + radius_margin (0.35) + clearance_margin (0.05)` =
**1.90 m of clear floor between the robot's edge and the object's edge**,
identical for every object, because object size only enters through the
half-diagonal that sets the non-overlap clearance:

| object | footprint | clearance | nav annulus | gate radius | edge gap |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| apple | 0.08 x 0.08 | 0.72 | [0.72, 2.22] | 2.57 | 1.90 m |
| coffee_table | 0.74 x 1.45 | 1.48 | [1.48, 2.98] | 3.33 | 1.90 m |
| armchair | 0.78 x 0.68 | 1.18 | [1.18, 2.68] | 3.03 | 1.90 m |

R1's arm reaches well under a metre, so placement from 1.9 m of clear floor is not
physically plausible. Tightening is one parameter -- `reach` -- and both the
annulus and the gate move together, so they cannot disagree. It is also close to
free: the outer ring of the wide annulus mostly falls outside the room or on
non-traversable floor, so shrinking it *raises* pose acceptance (coffee table
48.8 % at reach 1.5, 60.0 % at 0.6). Measured at reach 1.5/1.0/0.8/0.6/0.4; only
0.4 starts costing apple poses.

**`reach` is now 0.6 and `DEFAULT_RADIUS_MARGIN` is 0.05** (user, 2026-09-09).
The margin used to be 0.35, which quietly added a third of a metre to every
manipulation gate; it is now only what it claims to be -- a guard for the float
comparison and the millimetres a base drifts during a settle -- so **`reach` alone
is the distance an agent may reach across**, and every non-navigation verb
(grasp, place, open/close, toggle) gates on it through `interaction_radius_for`.

Resulting gap is a uniform **0.70 m** of clear floor: gate radius 1.37 m for an
apple, 1.83 m for an armchair, 2.13 m for the coffee table. The *gap* is what is
uniform, not the centre distance, and it cannot be the latter -- the coffee
table's own clearance is 1.48 m, so a centre distance tight enough to mean
anything for an apple would make the table unreachable from any pose.

Measured on the same seed, tightening 0.8 -> 0.6 **helped**: goal at env_step 1230
against 1485, and `TOO_FAR` 15 -> 11, with `NO_SPACE_AROUND_TARGET` still 0. A
narrower annulus puts the sampled standing pose closer to the target, so the
travel charge (60 ticks/m) shrinks. Any metric recorded before this has different
travel costs and is not comparable.

## Agent start poses are sampled, but seed-determined (2026-09-09)

`place_robots` calls `th.manual_seed(seed)` and then samples, so a run's robot
poses are a pure function of (scene, room, seed, robot geometry) -- not random
run to run, and not a fixed configured pose either. Verified by re-running
`place_robots` on one loaded scene: seed 0 -> (-7.55, 0.05)/(-10.15, 0.85),
seed 1 -> (-11.35, 1.85)/(-11.75, -1.95), seed 2 -> different again, and
returning to seeds 0 and 1 reproduced both exactly. `seed=None` differs every
call. Today's logs are the same result from the other direction: every seed-0 run
printed one of exactly two placements, and the switch between them is the commit
that stopped simulating the template's robots -- because `robot_radius` changed,
which changes both the trav-map erosion and the separation requirement.

Consequences for the metrics sweep: **the seed varies the agents' start poses and
nothing else about the scene.** The object layout is frozen in the cached
template, so across seeds only the start poses (hence travel distances and who is
nearer which apple) and the LLM's own sampling differ. Placement constraints are
also worth stating: one room, mutual separation >= 2 x robot_radius (1.236 m),
within `cluster_radius` 6 m of the first robot, and on traversable eroded floor.

## Why an agent flashed in the kitchen at startup (2026-09-09)

Robots are *created* at the placeholder poses in `build_multi_robot_config`, and
`og.Environment`'s construction and reset render several frames before
`place_robots` moves them into the task room. Those placeholders were
`[1.5 * i, 0, 0.05]`, and (0, 0) is inside the house -- `kitchen_0` in
Pomaria_1_int, whose floor spans x [-13.7, 1.1] -- so every episode opened with
both agents visible in the kitchen for a moment. It only became visible when the
template's robots stopped being the ones simulated (they came up already in the
living room). Placeholders are now parked at (-50 - 2i, -50), outside the floor
plan: nothing renders inside the house before placement, and having no floor for
those few frames is harmless because `place_robots` zeroes velocity on arrival.



## Primitive latency, measured (2026-09-09, reach 0.8)

`feasibility_verify/measure_primitive_latency.py`. One tick is one `env.step`,
i.e. 1/30 s at the default action frequency.

| primitive | ticks | seconds | what sets it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grasp` | **101** (n=4, no spread) | 3.4 | one `_settle_robot` |
| `place_on_top` | **101** (n=4, no spread) | 3.4 | one `_settle_robot` |
| `navigate_to` | **~100 + 60 per metre** | 5.9-11.0 measured | travel charge + settle |
| `wait(n)` | **n + 1** | n/30 | exactly what it is asked for |
| any rejected precondition | **51** | 1.7 | `apply_ref` settles after catching |

So ~100 ticks is the floor of every physical primitive, and `navigate_to` is the
only one whose cost varies -- `DEFAULT_TRAVEL_TICKS_PER_METER` (60) is charged on
the distance to the **sampled standing pose**, not to the object's centre. Verified
against the `[nav]` lines: 3.8 m -> 227 ticks, 2.1 m -> 129, 0.9 m -> 53. Do not fit
ticks against centre distance; the pose is anywhere in the annulus and the fit
invents a slope (it suggested 31 ticks/m).

**Budgeting an episode**: one apple is navigate + grasp + navigate + place, so
roughly `4 x 100 + 60 x (d1 + d2)` -- about 500-700 ticks for in-room distances,
and both apples in parallel put the goal around env_step 1300-1500, which is what
runs actually report. A failed action adds 51 ticks and, because it terminates the
plan, one more LLM round trip.

Note these are much cheaper than the pre-2026-09-08 figures (grasp 500,
place_on_top 750, navigate ~490-550) quoted elsewhere in this file: those were
inflated by upstream retrying a placement whose predicate check was lying (the
sleeping-apple bug) and by the release settle that placement no longer performs.

## Second activity: coop_nine_apples_hall (2026-09-09)

`bddl3/bddl/activity_definitions/coop_nine_apples_hall/problem0.bddl` -- nine
`straight_chair`s and one `coffee_table-cjjayg` in `hall_glass_ceiling`'s
`empty_room_0`, an apple on each chair, goal = all nine on the table. Sampled the
documented way (`feasibility_verify/sample_nine_apples_hall.py`:
`online_object_sampling: True` -> `Environment(...)` -> `save_task()`), with the
model pinned via `sampling_whitelist` and the robot entries stripped afterwards so
`--agents` still controls the robot count.

Verified: BEHAVIOR's own `verify_definition` passes, all nine apples sit on their
own chairs after a 300-step settle, the goal is False at t=0, and the cached
instance loads with **nine** robots (9 apples + 9 chairs in scope, table is
`coffee_table-cjjayg`).

Notes worth keeping:

* `hall_glass_ceiling` has rooms `empty_room_0`, `corridor_0`, `bathroom_0`, and
  contains **no chairs and no tables** -- so every chair and the table are
  *imported* objects. That is why the init block uses
  `(ontop straight_chair.n.01_N floor.n.01_1)` and not `inroom`: `inroom` binds
  to furniture the scene already has. The `ontop ... floor.n.01_1` idiom is the
  standard one, used by 1008 shipped activities.
* `tests/bddl_tests.py batch_verify` **cannot run in this checkout** -- it
  hardcodes `parse_domain("omnigibson")` and only `domain_behavior-1k.bddl` and
  `domain_behavior-100.bddl` exist, so it dies before reaching any activity. Run
  `verify_definition` directly with `parse_domain("behavior-1k")` instead.
* **The distances are the problem, not the sampling.** `ontop floor` lets the
  sampler use the whole room and this hall is ~50 x 57 m. The cached draw puts
  chairs 4.7-43.0 m from the table (nine round trips = 550 m ~ 33 000 travel
  ticks at 60 ticks/m), and `place_robots` starts the team ~47-53 m away because
  it clusters around wherever the first pose lands. Budget accordingly -- of the
  order of 60 000 steps, against 4 000 for the two-apple Pomaria task -- or
  re-sample for a tighter draw, or centre the furniture deliberately.

## Heterogeneous robots and one-LLM-per-team (2026-09-10)

Three changes, done in order, each verified before the next.

### 1. A team layout JSON says who is in the scene

`coop2/behavior_env/team_config.py`, `--team-config PATH` on the runners. One
file carries what each robot is, where it starts and who it works with, because
those three are not independent -- a team is a set of named robots, and a name
means nothing until that robot has a model and a place to stand.

    {"robots": [
      {"name": "agent_0", "model": "R1",    "position": [-8.5, -1.5], "team": "alpha"},
      {"name": "agent_1", "model": "Tiago", "room": "living_room_0",  "team": "alpha"},
      {"name": "agent_2", "model": "R1",    "room": "kitchen_0",      "team": "bravo"}
    ]}

Exactly one of `position` (exact world coordinates) or `room` (a room *instance*,
sampled inside it) per robot. `place_robots` applies pinned poses first so that
sampled robots keep clear of them rather than the reverse, and `cluster_radius`
became per room -- keeping everyone within 6 m of the first robot placed is
unsatisfiable once robots are in different rooms. A pinned pose too close to
another warns rather than refuses: two robots deliberately close together is a
legitimate thing to study.

Verified on GPU with `coop2/team_layouts/pomaria_mixed.json`: 3 robots built
(the layout beat `--agents 99`), models r1/**tiago**/r1, the pinned robot at
drift 0.000 m, and the other two in `living_room_0` and `kitchen_0` as asked.

**Robot models are a registry, not a fixed list**, because importing non-BEHAVIOR
robots is planned. Such a robot needs one thing from coop2 -- a primitives-style
YAML carrying the controller stack the symbolic primitives require -- so that is
the whole extension point: `"config": "/path/to/myrobot_primitives.yaml"` in the
layout, or `register_robot_model(name, path)` at import time. Nothing else here
asks what kind of robot it is driving; `q_to_action` and the base joints are the
only interface. Only r1, r1pro and tiago ship such a YAML.

### 2. One LLM per team -- the unit of all three topologies

`coop2/comm_topology/llm_team.py`. **Not a fourth mode.** individual /
broadcast_chain / centralized describe how *teams* address each other; inside
every team one LLM plans for all its robots. All three runners take
`--team-size K` (or `--team-config`) and default to 1, which is exactly their old
one-LLM-per-robot behaviour -- a generalisation, not a replacement. There is no
`run_team.py`.

**A team is the address, on both sides.** `wait_for` and `send_to` hold *team
names*; `TeamBrain._say` goes through `MessageBroker.send_team_message`; the log
records `sender: "team_0", recipients: ["team_1"], sender_type: "team"`.
Delivery still reaches every robot of an addressed team -- an interrupt has to
stop all of it, or the team splits across I and W and stalls its own interrupt
barrier -- but that expansion is the broker's (`delivered_to`), not the address.

The wiring used to be in agent ids: a team was addressed as its four robots and
waited on through whichever member "spoke for" it. Three things followed from
that, and all three are gone with it -- every send was credited to a robot that
had no part in composing it; one conversation between two teams appeared in the
log as four; and a team's own inbox, being the union of four robot inboxes,
quoted the same message four times into its next prompt. `_collect_heard`
de-dupes on (sender, timestamp, content) for the same reason.

Three brains carry the roles: `ChainTeamBrain` waits on the preceding team's
speaker then broadcasts its allocation onward; `LeaderTeamBrain` interrupts the
follower teams for status, waits, then plans; `FollowerTeamBrain` answers from
its own state rather than spending an LLM call to paraphrase what it already
knows. What a team heard goes into its next prompt.

The prompt says so too. `build_team_system_prompt` (not `build_system_prompt`,
which tells a model it *is* a robot and asks it for one plan) opens with "You
command TEAM 'team_0' -- 4 robots (...)" and carries `TEAM_ENV_DESCRIPTION`, the
same world in the third person: "a robot must be closer than", "give it wait",
"never give one robot an id that appeared only under another robot". The two
descriptions are separate texts and drift silently, so
`test_team_prompt_stubbed.py` fails if a shared rule leaves either one.

A team shares one brain: every member's observation goes into one prompt and the answer
is one plan per robot, so the allocation is made once and is visible. Four robots
on the two-apple task, one call:

  [team_0] allocation: The two apples are split between agent_1 and agent_3, the
  robots currently positioned within reach of distinct apples. Agents 0 and 2
  wait rather than duplicating claims.

**The barrier is the whole design problem, and it deadlocks if done naively.**
The requirement is that members return to reasoning together, once all have
finished. But the plan loop does not step the env while any agent is not ready
(`run_*.py`: `while not all(agent.ready)`), so a member that finished early and
simply waited would freeze the world -- and its teammates need the world to
advance to finish. That deadlocks on the first uneven round.

So an early finisher stays **ready** and holds position: a short `wait` plan,
repeated until the team is complete. The idle time is real and shows up in the
plan log as `wait_for_team(...)`, which is the honest price of a joint decision
point. `TeamBrain._awaiting` tracks who is done *across* those holds, so a member
idling three times is still "waiting to plan", not "planning again".

Messages interrupt the whole team; the brain answers resume-or-replan per robot
in one call. Per robot because a message that changes one robot's job usually
leaves the others' plans good. No deadlock there -- an interrupt reaches every
member at once.

One call per round, not N: the runners spawn a thread per agent, so the brain
locks and the first thread through makes the call while the rest read the result.

A team of one behaves exactly like the individual topology, which is why an
unteamed robot gets a team of its own: one-LLM-per-robot is this code at N=1,
not a second code path. `--team-size K` groups `--agents N` without a JSON file.

**Holding is decided against the barrier, not against the plan dict.** Two races
made a member idle through its own team's decision, and both were found in a
run's `agent_states.json` rather than by reading:

* A member that got "hold" and was still acting on it when the last teammate
  arrived is in R, which `_recall_holders` deliberately leaves alone -- R is not
  an idle state. It then went ready with a hold and sat in W for the whole call
  (measured: 15.8 s of `waiting` against its teammates' 15.8 s of `reasoning`).
* Asking the brain once more before committing to the hold is not enough: the
  recall runs *before* the call, so at that moment there is no plan to hand back.

`claim_pending_plan` settles it on whether the team is complete. If it is, the
member waits in R for the round to finish -- safe, because a frozen world is
exactly what the team is waiting on and the call needs no simulation -- and
counts `rounds` to tell "the call has not started" from "the call finished
without me". If it is not, teammates really are still working, and it holds.

**A robot has no role and no speaker order of its own any more** -- both belong
to its team. Three leftovers from the per-robot world were each caught by a run
rather than by reading: a helper that built agents before `team_layout` was in
scope, `agent.speaker_order` in the chain runner, and
`isinstance(agent, LLMLeaderAgent)` in the centralized one. They read
`agent.brain` now.

**Trap, found by the first GPU run.** The hold plan was built through
`parse_plan_response`, whose `_ensure_task_terminal_action` appends an action
matching the plan's TaskSpecification. Written as `holding(<self>)` that appended
`grasp(<self>)` -- a robot planning to pick *itself* up, which really appeared in
a run's plan log. Holds are constructed directly now, and the test asserts a hold
has exactly one action rather than only checking the first.

### 3. gpt-5.6-terra when the team prompt is too much for luna

No code change -- `--model gpt-5.6-terra`. Both models honour the team schema
(probed directly). On four robots, same seed and task, terra allocated both
apples correctly on its first team call where luna needed a second round:

| model | goal @ step | holds | team LLM calls |
|---|---|---|---|
| gpt-5.6-luna | 1203 | 8 | 2 |
| gpt-5.6-terra | **358** | 2 | **1** |

One seed, so this is not a ranking -- but the mechanism behind the gap is
visible, not inferred: one planning round against two.

## Open defects

Fixed ones are not listed here -- the fix and its reasoning live in the commit
and in the code comment at the site. What is still true:

1. **A rejected precondition costs 50 ticks, not 0.** ``apply_ref`` runs its
   "settle before returning" block after catching the error and before raising
   the group, so ``TOO_FAR`` and friends are not free. Visible in the plan log
   as ``ticks=50`` on a failed action.
2. **cuRobo, if it is ever reintroduced, rejects poses on the other robot but
   not poses on a small object.** Measured 2026-09-05: 8/8 candidate poses
   collision-free from 0.05 m to 0.45 m from a 5 cm apple, because the base
   genuinely clears it -- a target-clearance floor is needed on top of any
   collision check. One generator per R1 costs ~2.2 GB and 4-8 s, and
   ``batch_size=16`` OOMs a 16 GB card in ``mg.warmup()``; the default is 2.
   cuRobo is currently **not used at all** (user decision): pose validity comes
   from the trav map plus geometry.

## The engine (L1c) in one paragraph

`MultiAgentPrimitiveEngine` is a **stepper, not a driver**: the caller owns the
main loop. `assign(agent_id, primitive, target)` starts a primitive without
advancing anything; `tick()` performs exactly one `env.step`, feeding each
active agent the next value from its `apply_ref` generator and every other
robot a hold-position action; `has_active(agent_id)` says whether an agent's
previous primitive is still in flight. `tick()` returns only the primitives
that terminated on that tick, so the normal return value is `{}`.

This shape exists so the barrier can sit at the **plan** boundary, matching
COOP²'s `PlanningEnvWrapper.step`:

```python
while not done:
    if not all_ready:                                  # plan-level barrier
        yield idle_step_return(...); continue          # tick() NOT called: physics frozen
    for agent_id in executing:
        if not engine.has_active(agent_id):
            engine.assign(agent_id, *next_primitive_of(agent_id))
    for agent_id, outcome in engine.tick().items():
        ...plan.advance_action() / complete_failed() / set_unready('plan_terminated')
```

`macro_step()` exists for scripted demos only. It aligns agents at every
primitive boundary, which COOP² does **not** do — never build the runner on it.

## Hard constraints (each of these fails silently or crashes)

- `scene.include_robots: false`, **and that is not sufficient with a BDDL
  activity.** `Environment._load_robots` is guarded by
  `if len(self.scene.robots) == 0`, so your `robots:` list is ignored whenever
  the scene has already imported robots -- which it has, because
  `BehaviorTask.verify_scene_and_task_config` points `scene_instance` at the
  cached template and the template contains the robots it was sampled with.
  The robots then come up with R1's defaults (IK arms, delta trunk) while
  `robot._controller_config` still reports yours, and nothing raises until
  `q_to_action` asserts on the first tick. `coop_env._enforce_controller_config`
  compares the live `ControllerView` registry against the config we built and
  calls `reload_controllers` when they disagree.
- `task.use_presampled_robot_pose: false`. The class default is **True** despite
  its docstring saying False, and a template sampled without presampled poses
  has no `robot_poses` metadata, so `BehaviorTask.reset` dereferences None.
  This facade places robots itself anyway.
- Every robot needs an explicit `name` — it is the action/obs dict key.
- Use `model: r1`, not the deprecated `type: R1`. Prefer **R1 over R1Pro**:
  cuRobo drops the DEFAULT embodiment at cuda capability (12,0) (RTX-50) while
  `update_obstacles` indexes it unconditionally → `KeyError`.
- `enable_head_tracking=False` always. `_overwrite_head_action` asserts
  `robot.model == "tiago"` and `_grasp` sets `_tracking_object`.
- `apply_ref(attempts=1)`. The default 5× retry is **not idempotent** and burns
  thousands of ticks per attempt.
- Call `tune_primitive_macros()` **before** constructing any controller: reading
  a macro locks it against writes. `coop_env._build` does this now -- it did not
  for most of the port, which left `MAX_STEPS_FOR_SETTLING` at upstream's 500
  and made a single PLACE_ON_TOP cost over 1000 ticks (`_release` and
  `_settle_robot` each burn the budget in full).
- Construct controllers only after the robots are at their reset pose —
  `_arm_targets` / `_reset_eef_pose` are frozen in `__init__`.
- Idle action is `robot.q_to_action(robot.get_joint_positions())`, **not**
  `controller._empty_action()` (which servos the arm to the frozen targets).
- `og.sim` is a process singleton. One env per process; parallel runs must
  fan out via subprocess.

## Primitive sets: what actually works

- **Physical** (`StarterSemanticActionPrimitives`): only GRASP, PLACE_ON_TOP,
  PLACE_INSIDE, NAVIGATE_TO, RELEASE. OPEN / CLOSE / TOGGLE_ON / TOGGLE_OFF
  `raise NotImplementedError`. One primitive costs 10³–10⁴ ticks.
- **Symbolic** (`SymbolicSemanticActionPrimitives`): OPEN/CLOSE/TOGGLE do work,
  but `NAVIGATE_TO` is **broken as shipped** — its inherited sampler
  dereferences the cuRobo motion generator the symbolic constructor never
  builds, and then passes a keyword the symbolic `_navigate_to_pose` rejects.
  Use `coop2.behavior_env.symbolic_navigation.NavigableSymbolicActionPrimitives`
  instead.
- Symbolic `_grasp` teleports the object to the end-effector **at any
  distance** and `_navigate_to_pose` is a pure teleport, so symbolic mode has
  essentially no resource contention as shipped. Use
  `symbolic_contention.ContentiousSymbolicActionPrimitives` (subclass of
  `NavigableSymbolicActionPrimitives`) to put it back — see below.

## Pose-filter comparison (measured 2026-09-05, N=9 planning)

`feasibility_verify/measure_pose_filters.py`, 120 candidate poses around apple_0,
one cuRobo generator as ground truth. R1 base radius measured **0.62 m**;
trav_map erosion radius **0.82 m**.

| filter | VRAM | scales to N=9 | holes vs cuRobo |
|---|---|---|---|
| per-robot cuRobo | 2.2 GB *each* -> 21.5 GB for 9 | **no** (card is 15.4 GB) | 0 by definition |
| shared cuRobo (`update_obstacles(ignore_objects=...)`) | ~2.2 GB total | yes | unverified: obstacles are expressed in the generator's own robot root frame |
| trav_map AND geometry | 0 | yes | **3 / 120** |

- `cuRobo accepts but geometry rejects = 76` is **not** a regression: it is almost
  entirely d <= 0.8 m, i.e. exactly the "standing on the apple" poses we want to
  reject and cuRobo does not.
- `cuRobo accepts but trav_map rejects = 84`: the baked `floor_trav_0.png` covers
  **all** of Rs_int's furniture, while the env loads only
  `["floors", "walls", "coffee_table"]`. The map is therefore more conservative
  than the actual scene. Loading full furniture would shrink this.
- The residual 3 holes survive raising robot separation from 0.8 to 1.3 m
  (`geometry accepts but cuRobo rejects` fell 15 -> 11, union stayed 3), so they
  are trav_map holes, not robot overlap. Cause not isolated.
- trav_map rejects 0/12 within 0.8 m of apple_0 -- that spot is genuinely cramped
  (it is also the `room=None` point). ~25% of candidates pass at d >= 1.0 m, so
  200 sampling attempts still succeed; the robot just stands further back.

## Scene choice: Rs_int is unusable (measured 2026-09-05)

`feasibility_verify/measure_teleport_risk.py` and `survey_scene_capacity.py`
read the baked `floor_trav_0.png` maps directly (0.01 m/px) -- CPU only, no
Isaac. R1's circumscribed radius is **0.62 m**
(`norm(reset_joint_pos_aabb_extent[:2]) / 2`, arms included).

| scene | bad-pose rate | dead targets | 9 robots fit? |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Rs_int** | **96.2%** | **46.3%** | no -- largest connected free region is **0.9 m2** |
| house_single_floor | 29.5% | 1.7% | yes (1709 m2) |
| Beechwood_0_int | 81.9% | 19.7% | marginal |
| Merom_1_int | 90.5% | 35.3% | no |
| office_large | 65.2% | 18.7% | marginal |

* **bad-pose rate** = sampled base poses landing where an R1 does not fit. A
  validity filter turns these into retries, so they are survivable.
* **dead targets** = targets with *no* valid pose anywhere in the 0-1.5 m
  annulus. A filter cannot help: NAVIGATE_TO just raises PLANNING_ERROR.

So **the scene must change before the filter matters**. Rs_int stays broken at
any radius (86.5% / 13.3% even at an unrealistically small 0.42 m). This is why
robots were visibly teleporting into walls and toppling in the demo videos.

Prefer a multi-room house over the big halls (`hall_arch_wood` has 4560 m2 but
is one undivided space): L1b's room-level world graph and COOP2's spatial
constraint both need real room separation. `house_single_floor` is the
candidate. 38 / 51 scenes fit 9 robots at 1.24 m separation.

## N=3 end-to-end, verified on GPU 2026-09-05

`house_single_floor`, `--n-robots 3 --plan navigate_to_then_grasp --contend`:
one winner, two losers, each with a legible reason.

```
agent_1  NAVIGATE_TO  153  ->  GRASP  success
agent_0  NAVIGATE_TO  272  ->  GRASP  OBJECT_CLAIMED (held by agent_1)
agent_2  NAVIGATE_TO  379  ->  GRASP  OBJECT_CLAIMED (held by agent_1)
overlap 0.75   env.step 431   wall clock 21 s
```

Two fixes got it there, and their effect was much larger than expected:

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| entities in the prompt | 218 | 47 |
| legal (primitive, target) pairs | 132 | 49 |
| env.step ticks | 2830 | 431 |
| wall clock | 214 s | 21 s |
| overlap ratio | 0.37 | 0.75 |

1. **Prompt filtering** (`symbolic_view.STRUCTURAL_SYNSETS` /
   `RECEPTACLE_ABILITIES`, since renamed from the original category lists). One corridor produced 78 walls, 24 shelves, 20
   switches, 16 downlights and 14 paintings, plus nonsense hints like
   `place_on_top(downlight#22)` and `place_inside(door#3)`. Filtering lives in
   L1b, **not** L1a: the world model stays complete for task evaluation and only
   the prompt is pruned.
2. **Objects clustered near the team** (`place_objects(near_robots=8.0)`).
   `place_robots` already clustered the robots, but objects were still sampled
   from the whole room -- a 20 m corridor put the contested apple 11 m away.

**Corrected 2026-09-08.** This section originally concluded: "the
`_settle_robot` blow-up was a symptom, not a separate defect ... no macro tuning
was needed", on the grounds that primitives went from 1100-1728 ticks to 118-379
once objects were clustered near the team. That conclusion is why
`tune_primitive_macros()` was written and then **never called**, and the defect
survived until 2026-09-08: with `MAX_STEPS_FOR_SETTLING` at upstream's 500, a
single PLACE_ON_TOP was measured at 1063 ticks and still rising
(`COOP2_ENGINE_VERBOSE=1` shows the count climbing linearly with env_step),
because `_release` and `_settle_robot` each burn the full budget and an R1's
holonomic base does not reach `velocity < 0.01`. Clustering objects helped, but
it did not remove the need for the macro -- both were required.

## M5 acceptance, GPU-verified 2026-09-06

One agent through the plan channel, no LLM
(`feasibility_verify/verify_plan_channel.py`):

```
navigate_to  success  551 ticks
grasp        success  100 ticks
navigate_to  success  523 ticks
place_on_top success  150 ticks
final held_objects: {}      decision_count=4   env_step=1328
apple relations: OnTop(apple#1, bookcase#2)
```

⚠️ **The first run of this printed PLAN COMPLETE while the apple was still in
the gripper.** `action_outcome` is true for exactly the tick its primitive
terminated on, but `step()` cached the whole `info` dict between refreshes and
served the stale outcome with it -- so every action reported its predecessor's
success the instant it was issued, and three of the four primitives never ran
(`decision_count` was 2, not 4). Fixed by always overwriting `action_outcome`
when reusing cached info. The status column could not catch this; only the
independent facts could -- `held_objects` and the scene graph's `OnTop`. Keep
verifying against physical state, not against the status field.

## Observation scope and refresh (decided 2026-09-06)

* `observation_for()` shows the agent's **current room only**;
  `include_seen_rooms=True` is opt-in. An observation that accumulates every
  room ever visited grows without bound over an episode and stops describing
  where the agent is, and the current room is the scope COOP2's spatial
  constraint is defined on anyway.
* The world model is rebuilt **only when a primitive terminates** — i.e. when an
  agent returns to the reasoning stage and actually has a reason to look. There
  is no timer refresh (`observation_every` defaults to 0): a primitive spans
  10^2–10^3 ticks, so a periodic rebuild would recompute the scene graph
  hundreds of times inside one primitive for nobody to read.

## Concurrent destination race (fixed 2026-09-06)

Separation was checked against other robots' **current** positions, which under
concurrency is a time-of-check/time-of-use bug. All N agents get NAVIGATE_TO on
the same tick; each samples its destination on its generator's first `next()`,
while every other robot still stands at its start pose metres away. Every check
passes, then all of them teleport beside the same object.

Measured on a 3-agent contend run: agent_0 and agent_1 ended **0.64 m** apart
against a 1.24 m requirement, and agent_1's assisted grasp latched onto
**agent_0** — `holding=agent_0`. The same `holding=<robot>` corruption the
separation filter was supposed to have removed.

Fix: `symbolic_navigation.DestinationRegistry`, **one per scene**, shared by
every controller. An agent reserves the pose it is about to occupy; every other
sampler avoids reservations as well as bodies. Reservations are overwritten,
never released — "this agent intends to be here" holds until it decides
otherwise, and once it arrives the reservation and its body coincide, so an
aborted primitive self-corrects instead of leaking a blocked spot.

After: closest pair 1.93 m, no `holding=<robot>`, and `OBJECT_CLAIMED` is back
as the contention signal instead of physics-induced `POST_CONDITION`.

The regression test is statistical on purpose: without the registry ~100/200
trials overlap, with it 0/200. A single-draw version of that assertion is flaky
(three random poses around one object are sometimes well separated) and would
eventually get deleted rather than fixed.

## L3 verified end-to-end, 2026-09-06

`feasibility_verify/verify_l3_plan_loop.py` drives the real
`PlanningEnvWrapper` (its ready barrier, plan lifecycle and logging) with a
scripted agent in place of the LLM:

```
Plan #1 navigate_to -> grasp -> release   all OK, SUCCEEDED at step 693
Plan #2 grasp(ghost#99)                   failed -> "terminating plan" -> reasoning
Plan #3 navigate_to                       OK -> complete -> reasoning
decision_count 4, env_step 888, barrier closed for exactly 3 ticks
```

Confirms the intended model: an arbitrary-length plan runs to completion
without the driver advancing it, only completion or failure returns the agent
to reasoning, and physics is frozen while it reasons.

⚠️ **Two executor sets is the trap here.** The facade builds
`CooperativeBehaviorEnv.executors` and calls `execute()` on them, while L3 reads
plan progress from `get_action_records()` on the *wrapper's*
`agent_actions`. When those were separate objects the wrapper's history stayed
empty, `action_status` came back None, and L3 re-issued action 1 forever. From
outside it is indistinguishable from a slow primitive -- it burned a 30-minute
timeout before being caught. `BehaviorSymbolicEnvWrapper._adopt_facade_executors`
now shares one executor per agent.

The verify script has a wall-clock cap and a stall detector (>12 primitives
issued without `current_action_index` moving) precisely because a timeout
cannot tell "slow" from "not progressing".

## Reuse audit (2026-09-06)

Systematic pass for hand-rolled code that OmniGibson or BDDL already provides.
Replaced:

| was | now |
|---|---|
| private `robot._ag_obj_in_hand` (3 sites) | `robot.is_grasping(arm, candidate_obj)` |
| `RECEPTACLE_CATEGORIES`, ~25 category names | `obj.abilities` (`fillable` / `openable`) from the taxonomy |
| `STRUCTURAL_CATEGORIES` name list | synset ancestry via `ObjectTaxonomy.is_descendant` |
| `imageio.get_writer` | `eval.utils.obs_utils.create_video_writer` / `write_video` |
| ids `apple#1` | BDDL instance naming `apple.n.01_1` |
| scene-graph edge labels | BDDL tokens via `bddl_utils.PREDICATE_TO_STATE` |
| hand-rolled erosion / connectivity / free-space sampling | `scene.get_random_point(floor, reference_point, robot)` |
| objects dropped on random floor cells | `obj.states[OnTop].set_value(surface, True)` |

A rendered fact is now `ontop(apple.n.01_1, breakfast_table.n.01_1)` -- the same
strings an activity definition and its goal predicates use, so M9's
`check_goal` needs no translation layer.

The state->token mapping matters more than it looks: `Hot` is
`object_states.Heated` and `Attached` is `AttachedTo`, so a name-equality check
would work for most predicates and fail silently on exactly those.

**BDDL cannot build the room world graph.** It is purely symbolic: its
predicate classes are empty (`class OnTop(BinaryPredicate): pass`), truth comes
from a callback into OmniGibson, `InRoom` is not even in `PREDICATE_TO_STATE`
so it cannot be evaluated at runtime, and `knowledge_base` is an offline
catalogue of what a scene's rooms contain *by design*, not what is in them now.
The live graph has to come from `SceneGraphBuilder` + `seg_map`, which is what
`world_state.py` does -- that part is not duplicated work.

Genuinely no upstream equivalent, and kept: mutual separation between N robots,
destination reservation under concurrency, room-scoped free space, the
concurrent primitive engine, and the symbolic contention layer.

Found while doing this: `is_fixed` was **always False**. `scene.fixed_objects`
is a `{name: obj}` dict, so `set(...)` of it is a set of names and `obj in` it
never matches. Nothing depended on it until `is_receptacle` did.

## Metrics: two different counters

`engine.env_step` counts ticks (what `Timeout(max_steps)` counts).
`engine.decision_count` counts primitives issued — **this is the denominator
for COOP²'s metrics**. One primitive is 10³–10⁴ ticks, so per-tick rates are
meaningless.

## Symbolic contention (L1)

`ContentiousSymbolicActionPrimitives` restores resource competition to the
distance-blind, holder-blind symbolic set with three coupled rules:

1. **Interaction radius** — GRASP / PLACE / OPEN / TOGGLE require the base
   within `interaction_radius` m of the target, else `TOO_FAR`.
2. **Travel cost** — `_navigate_to_pose` yields hold-position ticks
   proportional to distance **before** teleporting. Padding after the teleport
   would be wrong: the robot would arrive instantly and then idle, so a
   teammate reading the world during those ticks sees it already there.
3. **Claims** — acting on an object another robot holds raises
   `OBJECT_CLAIMED`. Upstream `_grasp` checks only `self.robot._ag_obj_in_hand`
   and `_establish_grasp` puts its joint under the *grasping* robot's eef, so
   without this the object is yanked out of the holder's hand, carries **two**
   FixedJoints, and both robots' post-conditions pass. Silent corruption.

⚠️ `interaction_radius` must be ≥ `distance_range[1]` (the nav sampler's upper
bound), or a successful navigate still sometimes lands out of range and the
agent loops navigate → TOO_FAR forever. The constructor rejects that outright;
the default derives the radius from `distance_range`.

Both new codes are raised as `PRE_CONDITION_ERROR` with
`metadata["reason_code"]` set; `ReasonCode.from_primitive_error` prefers that
over the five-member enum.

**Both are in `TERMINATES_PLAN`** (decided 2026-09-06). They are individually
recoverable — a teammate may release the object, walking closer fixes the
distance — but the plan that produced them was written against a world that has
since contradicted it, so its next action is a stale intention. Terminating
returns the agent to the **reasoning stage**, which is the only place it can
negotiate for the contested object or retarget. Grinding the plan on instead
would turn contention into silent wasted motion rather than a decision the
topology layer is measured on.

## M9: BDDL reconnected — first custom task (2026-09-07)

A real BDDL activity now exists and is cached as a task instance, and `coop_env`
already loads it (`bddl_activity=...` -> `BehaviorTask` with
`online_object_sampling=False`) with `compiled_task.check_goal` deciding `terminated`.
This section is the authoring record: how the activity was written and how to
regenerate the instance.

**The task**: `bddl3/bddl/activity_definitions/coop_two_apples_pomaria/problem0.bddl`
— `Pomaria_1_int` / `living_room_0`, one apple on each of the two armchairs, goal is
`(forall (?apple.n.01 - apple.n.01) (ontop ?apple.n.01 ?coffee_table.n.01_1))`.

```bash
# produce the instance (~45 s, writes the template json). NOT in git -- re-run after a machine change.
OMNIGIBSON_HEADLESS=1 python -u feasibility_verify/sample_coop_task_instance.py
# acceptance test: loads the cached template, forces the goal, checks check_goal flips
OMNIGIBSON_HEADLESS=1 python -u feasibility_verify/verify_coop_task_instance.py
```

Template lands at
`$OMNIGIBSON_DATASET/2026-challenge-task-instances/scenes/Pomaria_1_int/json/Pomaria_1_int_task_coop_two_apples_pomaria_0_0_template.json`.
`BehaviorTask` finds it on its own — with `online_object_sampling: false` and no
`scene_file`/`scene_instance`, `verify_scene_and_task_config` rebuilds that exact
filename from `{scene}_task_{activity}_{def_id}_{inst_id}_template`.

### Authoring facts (all verified, not read off docstrings)

- **A new activity directory is auto-discovered.** `get_all_activities()` is `os.listdir`
  on `activity_definitions/`; `activity_manifest.txt` and
  `activity_to_preselected_scenes.json` are read by no code at all.
  `kb.add_task(name, definition=<string>)` registers one at runtime with no files, but then
  `room_requirements` stays empty and `task.matching_scene(scene)` falsely returns "pass" —
  only the file route gets a real pre-flight check. Use `matching_scene` before burning a
  GPU run; it names the missing furniture per room instance.
- **`sampling_whitelist` is `{synset: {category: {model: None-or-bbox}}}`** — a dict, not
  the "list of valid models" the `BehaviorTask` docstring claims (`bddl_utils.py:894` calls
  `.keys()` on it). It is the only way to pin one of several same-synset scene objects:
  `living_room_0` has two coffee tables and BDDL only knows the synset.
- **Declare exactly one agent.** Omitting it entirely crashes `BDDLSampler.__init__` at
  `bddl_utils.py:486` with `KeyError: 'agent.n.01_1'`, because `update_activity` puts that
  key in `object_scope` unconditionally while `_object_instance_to_synset` comes from
  `parsed_objects`. Declaring a *second* agent also crashes (the sampler binds only
  `agent.n.01_1`, leaving `None` for the rest, and `_filter_object_scope` then dereferences
  `None.prim_type`); it works only with a patch to `bddl_utils.py:553`, which was written,
  verified, and then **reverted on purpose** — OmniGibson is unmodified. Robots past
  `robots[0]` are simply invisible to BDDL, which costs nothing while no goal mentions an
  agent. The *cached* path never needed the patch: `behavior_task.py:548` already maps
  `agent.n.01_N -> env.robots[N-1]`.
- **`inroom` cannot be evaluated** (`PREDICATE_TO_STATE` has no `InRoom`), so
  `compiled_task.check_initial_conditions()` raises `KeyError` on any task using it. Check
  the kinematic facts directly instead. Same trap for `broken` and `grasped`; `grasped` is
  one dict line away from working (`object_states.IsGrasping` already exists).
- **Sampling is unseeded and apples roll.** Different apple models get drawn per instance
  and one rolled off the armchair during the 300-step settle. Both apples are pinned to
  model `omzprq` via the whitelist, and the script exits non-zero rather than save a layout
  whose own initial conditions are already violated. Always cache a template; never sample
  per run. `--instance_id N` produces alternative layouts.

### The template is the scene, so what it omits is missing from every run

`save_task(task_relevant_only=False)` writes whatever was **loaded**, and the
template *is* the scene file each episode loads. So any load filter used while
sampling is baked into every later run.

The sampling script used to pass `load_room_types: ["living_room"]`, and that
produced a house with exactly one floor. Upstream exempts building structure from
the room filter, but the exemption is
`STRUCTURE_CATEGORIES - GROUND_CATEGORIES` and `floors` is a GROUND category
(`interactive_traversable_scene.py`) -- so walls and ceilings bypassed the filter
and floors did not. Every episode since has run in a house whose other six rooms
had no ground: 50 objects, 22 walls, 7 ceilings, **1 floor**. Nothing failed, which
is why it survived; it was visible the moment anyone opened `--gui`.

Filter removed and the template re-sampled: 124 objects and **7 floors**, one per
room (bathroom_0, corridor_0, kitchen_0, living_room_0, pantry_room_0,
storage_room_0, utility_room_0). Scene load goes 38 s -> 78 s. A run still solves
the activity (`individual`, seed 0, goal at env_step 2154).

**The layout changed with it.** Sampling is unseeded, so the re-draw moved the
apples (`apple_48`/`apple_49` are now `apple_122`/`apple_123`); the armchairs and
`coffee_table_gpkbiw_0` are the same instances. The 1303/1303/1278 three-topology
numbers above were measured on the one-floor template and are **not** comparable
to anything sampled after it -- treat them as a pre-change baseline and re-run the
sweep for the real table.

The script now also asserts that `armchair.n.01_{1,2}` and `coffee_table.n.01_1`
bind inside `ROOM_INSTANCE`. `inroom ... living_room` matches a room *type*, and
with the whole scene loaded the sampler could otherwise bind the furniture to a
different living_room instance than the one `place_robots` uses, leaving the team
in an empty room.

### What the template does and does not carry

- Robot **world poses are in there**, but as `joint_pos` of the holonomic base joints, not
  `root_link.pos` — the root stays at the spawn/park anchor (`agent_0` reads
  `[300, 300, 300]`). Real pose = anchor + first three joint values.
- Robot **controller configs are NOT in there.** `init_info.args` holds only
  `name / model / obs_modalities / default_reset_mode / scale`; the saved
  `controller_groups` is goal *state*, and its `arm_left` goal is `target_pos` +
  `target_ori_mat`, i.e. the R1 **default task-space controller**, not the
  `JointController` stack `r1_primitives.yaml` requires.
- ⇒ **Load it with `include_robots: False`** and supply coop2's own robot list. The template
  then contributes only the object layout (apples, armchairs, coffee table), which is all we
  want from it; `build_multi_robot_config` already sets that flag.
- `env.reset()` restores the initial file, so poses set after loading need either
  re-applying each reset or a `scene.update_initial_file()` (`prepare_robots` does this).

## The seven blockers, in the order they were found (2026-09-08)

All fixed, and all seven had to go before any topology could finish the activity.
The seventh -- the sleeping apple, section above -- is the one that made the other
six look insufficient, because it hid success even when the agents played well.

| # | symptom | cause | fixed |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | every plan died at grounding, `decisions` stayed 0 | the runners inherited crafter's `CooperativeEnv(...)` call and placed no objects | `77d175296` |
| 2 | ~3.4 s per env_step | two all-pairs scans per macro-step: `SceneGraphBuilder.step()` (14.9 s) and `CoopTaskTracker._fact_set()` (9.4 s) | `77d175296` |
| 3 | agent placed apples on the wrong coffee table, `check_goal` never fired | `entity_id_for` numbered instances in scene order, independently of `task.object_scope`; `living_room_0` has two coffee tables | `5fda3d283` |
| 4 | a single `PLACE_ON_TOP` cost >1000 ticks, so 2500 steps bought ~2 primitives per agent | `tune_primitive_macros()` existed, was measured (1100-1728 -> 118-379 ticks) and **was never called**; `MAX_STEPS_FOR_SETTLING` stayed at upstream's 500, and `_release` + `_settle_robot` each burn it in full | `efe4c0159` |
| 5 | `wait` was an instant no-op, so an agent yielding the floor **stopped the world** (the plan loop does not step the env while any agent reasons) | `wait` was in `COMMUNICATION_ACTIONS` | `5fda3d283` |
| 6 | 51 x `NO_SPACE_AROUND_TARGET`, all `{room: 200, trav: 0, robots: 0}`, target logged at 12 m -> 27 m -> 36 m -> 38 m from the room | upstream's `_place_with_predicate` does release -> `set_position_orientation` -> settle, and **`set_position_orientation` does not zero velocity**: the object arrives carrying the fall it accumulated while being released, and the settle integrates it out of the house | `efe4c0159` |
| 7 | `place_on_top` failed "it did not come to rest there" on a third to a half of placements, and `check_goal` never fired even after an apple was correctly delivered | `OnTop` is `Touching`, `Touching` is a contact-report query, and a slept PhysX actor reports no contacts; the default sleep threshold is 5e-05 and `keep_still()` zeroes the velocity on the way in | `e205c0e0b` |

Method note, because it cost most of the day: for #6 I proposed three geometric
explanations (the annulus round the table is full; the target is being carried by a
teammate; `DestinationRegistry` reservations accumulate) and **measured all three to
be wrong** -- `feasibility_verify/measure_target_capacity.py` shows 28-48 % of
candidate poses accepted in every reproducible state, so 200 consecutive rejections
were impossible. What settled it was making the failure report its own attribution
(`rejected_by` per filter, plus `target_xy`) rather than reproducing states by hand.
Same shape as #2, where four rounds of guessing lost to one cProfile run.

## Diagnostics that exist now, use them first

- `feasibility_verify/preview_cameras.py` -- one frame per camera view, then stops.
  Framing cannot be checked by reading pose numbers; four wrong poses got through
  that way. Also renders control shots straight at each robot, which separates "the
  framing is wrong" from "nothing renders".
- `feasibility_verify/measure_target_capacity.py` -- per-filter rejection histogram
  around any target, with and without a teammate parked next to it.
- `COOP2_ENGINE_VERBOSE=1` -- per-primitive progress lines (`agent_0:PLACE_ON_TOP@1063`).
  This is what exposed #4: tick counts rising linearly with env_step and never ending.
- `[nav]` lines -- sampled pose, distance and travel ticks charged, one per navigate.
- `NO_SPACE_AROUND_TARGET` metadata carries `rejected_by` and `target_xy`.

## Open, not yet diagnosed

- **Models mangle instance suffixes.** `apple.n.01_01` for `_1` appeared in three
  separate runs; `resolve_target` now normalises zero padding. But putting the id in
  the goal text produced `coffee_table.n.01_01_1` -- a *doubled* suffix, which the
  normaliser does not handle. Prompt wording was tried first and did not hold.
- **`TOO_FAR` after a successful `navigate_to` to the same object** (16 in one run).
  The prompt promises navigation puts you in range. The object was being carried by a
  teammate, so it moved; and the code returned `TOO_FAR` rather than `OBJECT_CLAIMED`,
  which means `holder_of` saw it as unheld -- consistent with the window inside
  `_place_with_predicate` where the object has been released but not yet placed.
- **`progress 0/4`** reads as "nothing started" when it means "action 1 is still
  running". Cosmetic, but it misled a diagnosis once.

## Deliberately not implemented

**Target arbitration as a lock.** Contention is enforced as a *precondition
failure*, never as a refusal at `assign()`. The loser still burns the full
navigate and still issues its GRASP, so the wasted decision stays visible to
the cognitive layer — that waste is exactly what the centralized leader's
allocation and the broadcast chain's proposals are measured on. A pre-
assignment lock would hide the signal. `engine.held_objects()` exposes the
cross-agent "who holds what" view for L1b's text observation to surface.
