"""Persist every LLM call of a run: the prompt in, the completion out.

Both already went to stdout when ``--llm-quiet`` was off, and stdout is exactly
where they stopped being useful -- several runs in this project were killed
mid-episode and left nothing behind but their videos, and a run that finishes
still leaves no record of what its agents were actually told (the goal text, for
instance, appears only in the prompt).

**JSON Lines, flushed per call, on purpose.** One object per line means a run
that is interrupted keeps every call it had already made, which a single JSON
array written at teardown does not. It also means the file can be read back with
a streaming pass instead of loading tens of MB at once.

Size: a call is roughly 8.5 k tokens of prompt, so budget ~35 kB per call --
about 2 MB for a 6-agent chain episode and ~15 MB for a 9-agent one, which puts
it in the same class as ``coop2_process_log.json``.
