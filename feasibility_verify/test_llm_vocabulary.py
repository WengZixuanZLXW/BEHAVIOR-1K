"""The three-piece M5 consistency check: schema <-> L2 <-> outcome codes.

Structured output *constrains* the model, so the Pydantic union is the exact
set of things an agent can ever say. If it disagrees with L2's verb table in
either direction the failure is quiet and expensive: a verb only in the schema
becomes a wasted decision every time it is chosen, and a verb only in L2 is
dead code the model can never reach.

Needs no GPU and no API key -- it compares two tables.

Run:
    python feasibility_verify/test_llm_vocabulary.py
