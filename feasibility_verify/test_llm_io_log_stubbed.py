"""CPU-only test for the per-run LLM call log.

No Isaac, no GPU, no model: a stub client returns canned completions and the
recorder is read back off disk. What is pinned is the reason the format was
chosen -- a run that dies mid-episode keeps every call it had already made --
and the fact that a logging failure cannot end an episode.

Run:
    python feasibility_verify/test_llm_io_log_stubbed.py
