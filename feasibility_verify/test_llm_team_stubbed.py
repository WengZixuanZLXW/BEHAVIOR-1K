"""CPU-only test for the one-LLM-per-team topology.

No Isaac, no GPU, no model: a stub client counts calls and returns canned team
responses. What is pinned is the part that cannot be checked by reading the code
-- the barrier -- because getting it wrong deadlocks rather than fails.

The trap: the plan loop does not step the environment while any agent is
not ready. So a member that finished early and simply waited for its teammates
would freeze the world, and those teammates need the world to advance in order
to finish. The design has early finishers stay ready and hold position instead,
and these tests are what keep that true.

Run:
    python feasibility_verify/test_llm_team_stubbed.py
